        Learned About Some Best Practices Using React
 Name the component capitalize e.g App.js
 We can name both App.js & App.jsx but in vite development environment we have to use jsx

 Created our own component Chai.jsx rendered successfully

This react series is recomended to visit and learn. Thanks
