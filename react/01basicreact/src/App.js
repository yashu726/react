    how to create react(npm create-react-app) and react_with_vite npm create vite@latest) and vite is much more fast why? 
                                           ----isme only react-dom aur react wala dependency hota hai..react jaise testing,script, web_vitals nhi hota..
   about the package.json.. isme se consi command se run hoga project like
                                              npm run dev your command here
